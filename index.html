            // Career interests and roles
            "roles": "I'm passionate about Product Design, UX Design, and UX Research roles because they allow me to combine my love for understanding user needs with creating meaningful digital experiences. What excites me most is the opportunity to bridge the gap between user research insights and tangible design solutions that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.",
            
            "career": "I'm particularly drawn to roles where I can influence the entire user experience journey - from conducting research to understand user pain points, to designing intuitive interfaces, and then validating those designs through testing. I believe great design happens when you truly understand your users.",
            
            "interested": "I'm most interested in Product Design and UX roles because they combine analytical thinking with creative problem-solving. I love the challenge of taking complex problems and turning them into simple, elegant solutions that users actually want to use.",

            // Projects and impact
            "projects": "I've led some exciting projects! At GoTogether, I guided a team of 3 UX designers to conduct 20 student interviews and redesign 80 screens for their carpooling app. I also won first place in a 2019 social innovation competition with 'Gaia' - an app concept for seamless retail while reducing paper waste. Currently working with ChangeArts to design their mobile platform from web interface, making art events more accessible for teachers and organizations.",
            
            "impact": "My GoTogether project involved comprehensive user research with 20 student interviews that directly informed our redesign of 80 screens. At Cogeco, I'm building scalable design system components and creating marketing landing pages that increase clarity and engagement. At meSO, I prototyped relationship-building app screens through multiple iterations based on user feedback. Each project taught me the importance of user-centered design and data-driven decision making.",

            "gotogether": "Leading the GoTogether app redesign was incredibly rewarding! I managed a team of 3 UX designers, conducted 20 student interviews, and redesigned 80 screens for their K12 student carpooling app. We focused on making carpooling safer and more accessible for students while aligning with the company's new branding. The project taught me a lot about team leadership and collaborative design processes.",

            // Skills and experience
            "skills": "I bring a unique combination of research skills, design thinking, and technical understanding. I'm proficient in Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Miro, Adobe XD, and HotJar, plus I know HTML and CSS. My background in Cognitive Science gives me a deep understanding of how users think and process information. I speak English, French, and Mandarin, which helps me design for diverse user groups.",
            
            "experience": "I've worked across various industries - from tech startups like meSO to established companies like Cogeco Connexion. My experience includes leading design teams, conducting user research, building design systems, creating marketing landing pages, and prototyping mobile apps. I've collaborated with developers, stakeholders, and cross-functional teams to bring designs to life.",

            "cogeco": "I'm currently doing a Product Design internship at Cogeco Connexion, contributing to Breezeline's design system by building scalable, reusable components. I'm also designing marketing landing pages for campaigns like flash sales and back-to-school deals. It's been amazing to work on design systems at scale and see how good component design impacts the entire user experience.",

            // Company-specific responses
            "adobe": "Adobe would be an amazing fit because of my passion for creative tools and design systems. Having worked on Cogeco's design system building scalable components, I understand how crucial consistency and reusability are at scale. Adobe's commitment to empowering creators aligns perfectly with my belief that good design should democratize creativity. My multilingual abilities (English, French, Mandarin) would help serve Adobe's global user base.",
            
            "shopify": "Shopify's mission to make commerce better for everyone really resonates with me. My experience redesigning the GoTogether app and working on marketing landing pages at Cogeco has given me insights into how design impacts business success. I'd be excited to help merchants succeed through better UX, and my background in user research would be valuable for understanding diverse merchant needs across different markets.",
            
            "cogeco": "Actually, I'm currently interning at Cogeco Connexion as a Product Designer! I'm contributing to Breezeline's design system and creating marketing landing pages. The experience has been incredible - working on design systems at this scale has taught me so much about creating consistent, scalable design solutions. I'd love to continue contributing to products that connect communities through better technology.",

            // Background and personal
            "background": "I'm Rosalie, and I'm fascinated by how design can solve real problems and improve people's experiences. My journey combines a strong academic foundation with hands-on experience. I have a Bachelor's from McGill in Cognitive Science with Computer Science & Linguistics, and I'm pursuing a Masters in Digital Experience Innovation at University of Waterloo. This background gives me deep insights into how users think and process information.",
            
            "education": "I have a unique educational background! Bachelor's from McGill in Cognitive Science focusing on Computer Science & Linguistics, currently pursuing my Masters in Digital Experience Innovation at University of Waterloo, plus a UX Design Certificate from Springboard and study abroad experience at HKU. This combination gives me both the theoretical understanding of human cognition and practical design skills.",
            
            "personal": "Outside of design, I'm a figure skating instructor and have been skating for over a decade - it's taught me discipline, precision, and how to break down complex movements into learnable steps. I also teach track and field, which has strengthened my coaching and communication skills. Both experiences have made me better at giving constructive feedback and helping others improve, skills that translate perfectly to design collaboration and user research.",
            
            "outside": "I teach figure skating and track and field in my spare time! Figure skating has been a huge part of my life for over ten years - it's taught me about attention to detail, grace under pressure, and the importance of practice and iteration (very relevant to design!). Teaching both sports has made me a better communicator and helped me learn how to break down complex concepts into understandable steps.",

            "languages": "I speak English, French, and Mandarin fluently! This helps me design for diverse user groups and understand different cultural perspectives in UX. It's been especially valuable when conducting user research and considering accessibility for global audiences.",

            // Specific project responses
            "meso": "At meSO, I collaborated with another UX Designer and 6 developers to prototype screens for a relationship-building app. We went through multiple iterations based on user feedback, which taught me the importance of rapid prototyping and user testing. I also designed the banner for their first exhibition, which was exciting because it required translating digital design skills to physical marketing materials.",

            "develop": "At Develop for Good, I'm designing ChangeArts' mobile platform from their existing web interface. The challenge is creating an easy and accessible experience for teachers and art organizations to find and register for art events. It's rewarding work because it directly impacts arts education and makes cultural experiences more accessible.",

            // General positive responses
            "fit": "I believe I'd be a great fit because I bring both the technical skills and collaborative mindset needed for successful design work. My Cognitive Science background helps me understand users deeply, my multilingual abilities help me design for diverse audiences, and my experience leading teams shows I can drive projects forward. Plus, my teaching background has made me excellent at communication and feedback.",
            
            "why": "What sets me apart is my combination of cognitive science knowledge, hands-on design experience, and genuine care for the end user. I don't just want to make things look good - I want to solve real problems. My experience leading the GoTogether team and conducting user research shows I can drive results while keeping users at the center of everything I do."
